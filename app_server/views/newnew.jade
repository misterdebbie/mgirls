            p#student I am a full stack developer, former fashion buyer. From art to fashion to tech, I forecast by interpreting and observing the surrounding environments to inform my design decisions and market trends. My outlook is bright and alive, responsive to the interactions I have with others. I am the conduit coursing between the digital world and the social by creating web applications that are mindful of the user. Leveraging my customer service skills in client building, I translate those insights into writing applications that consider the needs of a user. My strength lies in shaping an experience that presents data in a digestible manner while simultaneously rendering a front end interface that is aesthetically vibrant.
