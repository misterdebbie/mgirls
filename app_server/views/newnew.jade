                I am a full stack developer, former fashion buyer. From art to fashion to tech, I forecast by interpreting and observing
                the surrounding environments to inform my design decisions and market trends.
              br
                My outlook is bright and alive, responsive to the interactions I have with others.
                I want to serve as the conduit between the digital world and the social by creating web applications that are mindful of the user.
              br
                Leveraging my customer service skills in client building, I translate those insights into writing applications that consider the needs of a user. My strength lies in shaping an experience that presents data in a digestible manner while simultaneously rendering a front end interface that is aesthetically vibrant.
